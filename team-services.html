                    you may have with Microcomsol related to the Service, constitutes

                    the entire agreement between you and Microcomsol. If a court of competent jurisdiction deems any
                    provision of this Agreement invalid, it

                    will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which will continue to be fully effective.
                    However, if the universal Class Action/Jury

                    Trial Waiver provision is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement will be
                    unenforceable.
